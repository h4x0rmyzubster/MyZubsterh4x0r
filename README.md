## 🚀 What is MyZubster?

MyZubster is a hyperlocal skill-sharing platform. It lets people in the same neighborhood offer services, request help, chat, and pay using Monero — all in a privacy-first, self-hosted environment.

The goal is to empower communities to collaborate directly, bypassing centralized platforms and reducing costs.
