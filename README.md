\# 🌐 MyZubster – The Open Source Service Exchange Ecosystem



\*\*MyZubster\*\* is more than just a payment gateway or a marketplace. It's a complete, self‑hosted ecosystem for exchanging services, skills, and value – powered by Monero, built with privacy, and designed for freedom.



> \*\*"Own your skills. Own your payments. Own your future."\*\*



\---



\## 📖 My Story – Why I Built This



I'm a developer who believes in \*\*financial freedom\*\* and \*\*self‑sovereignty\*\*. For years, I watched centralized platforms take a cut from every transaction, control user data, and dictate the rules. I wanted to build something different.



Something that gives power back to the people.



\*\*MyZubster is that vision.\*\* It's a platform where anyone can:

\- Offer their skills to a global audience

\- Get paid instantly in Monero – without banks, without borders

\- Keep their data private and under their control

\- Earn from their own marketplace by setting their own fees



I built this because I believe in \*\*peer‑to‑peer exchange\*\*. I believe that value should flow freely between people, not through middlemen. And I believe that open source is the only way to build trust.



This is my contribution to a freer, more private world.

👨‍💻 About the Author



Daniel Ioni – Self‑Taught Developer \& Monero Advocate



I'm a 38‑year‑old Italian developer based in Rimini, with a deep passion for privacy, financial freedom, and open‑source technology.



My journey started with Bitcoin mining and evolved into a deep involvement with the Monero community. I founded "Monero Italia" on Facebook, a group dedicated to spreading awareness about privacy‑focused cryptocurrencies in Italy. Over the years, I've gained experience in mining, trading, and building marketplaces – always with a focus on decentralization and user sovereignty.



Beyond the code, I'm a cat lover – I have a little companion named Chanel who keeps me company during late‑night coding sessions. 🐱



My vision for MyZubster is simple: to create a free, open, and accessible ecosystem where anyone can exchange services and skills without intermediaries. I believe that technology should empower people, not control them. That's why MyZubster is 100% open source – anyone can use it, contribute to it, modify it, or build their own business on top of it.



The only rule? Use it for good. No illegal activities. Everything else is fair game.



I hope MyZubster can evolve into a global platform where freedom, privacy, and peer‑to‑peer exchange become the new standard. This is my contribution to a more open and equitable world.
